# PlatformGame

This is a demo showing some of my ability to create a simple platform game than can be played on any computer. 
Some of the features in this demo includes handling object collision, scrolling backgrounds, responding to keyboard inputs and reacting
to colliding with certain objects. 

To get the game started simply clone the files from github and run the "main.py" file and it should start shortly. 

There is no objective in this game as it is more of a demo, movement is controlled with the arrow keys and players can jump
using the spacebar (hint: hit it twice for a double jump) once you're satisfied with the game simply hit the red x in the top
right corner of the screen to exit 

Enjoy and thank you for taking the time to read this!
